<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr>
<p1> I'm an aspiring Computer Engineer who likes the balance between Computer Science & 
Electrical Engineering. The reason I chose to pursue such a major was because from a
young age, my older brother would break apart and fix computer monitors, and as I kid I was always curious to find out how these devices (motherboards, capacitors, etc.) were able to make a screen light up and display text. This exposure sparked my interests in
the field of Computer Engineering!</p1>
